# LogIn-Register-System
This is a LogIn and Register system to help me learn HashMaps, JTextField and JPasswordField. 

You can create multiple accounts (checks if login is already taken or password is incorrect) and then log in to your account (checks if account exsists and whether password is correct). All accounts cease to exist after closure of a program.
